//In Cairo, a snapshot is an immutable view of a value at a certain point in time.
//Recall that memory is immutable, so modifying a value actually creates a new memory cell. 
//The old memory cell still exists, and snapshots are variables that refer to that "old" value. 
//In this sense, snapshots are a view "into the past".
